# Belly Button Biodiversity

In hopes of finding a way to make lab created beef taste more realistic, Roza is conducting a study on behalf of Improbable Beef. They are looking at the bacteria that live in people's belly buttons in hopes of finding one that gives the fake meat a real meaty flavor. She is creating a dashboard to help visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
